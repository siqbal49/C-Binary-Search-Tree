Simple Binary Search Tree implementation in C. 
The main program initializes the tree in memory, inserts a series of nodes, and then traverses the tree to print out to the console. 
Memory is freed at the end. 
Data class represents each node of the binary search tree. 
bst class is the implementation of the binary search tree data structure.
